# Summary of learning

I learned quite a bit in this class but I think the biggest things I learned were how to use data to create a graph using Looker studio.
There was a learning curve with it and it took me a while to figure it out, but now I know a way to put data sets into a visual representation.
I also learned how to use Github and how to use some code language in the process. I believe that being able to use Github will be advantages to me
in my career. I also believe what code I've learned so far will be good for the future as well.
